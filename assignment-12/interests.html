                <h1>My Interests</h1>

                <h2>My interests include filmmaking, gaming, hiking, and playing basketball.
                    Im excited to join this class as learning coding and website creation has 
                    been something that I have been interested in since I was a child. I hope 
                    that this could help me lay the ground work for other coding endaevors as 
                    I'm curious about getting into game design.

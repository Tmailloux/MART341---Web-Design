Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?

I would say in general my favorit artistic medium is film, although I'll always have a soft spot for anything related to the internet.
I enjoy films accessibilty when it comes to large audiences and I think the internet does something similar, but in regards to all kind of art.
Although, while the internet is very open ended and constantly changing, I enjoy film for having a defining end to the narrative.
